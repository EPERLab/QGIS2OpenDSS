description=This plugin reads geographic information of electric distribution circuits and exports its configuration to OpenDss
version=3.0
author=EPERLAb / Universidad de Costa Rica
email=eperlab.eie@ucr.ac.cr

The plugin does this based on the relative distance between each of the elements of the distribution circuit. The results can be read with OpenDSS to run different studies about the circuit.
